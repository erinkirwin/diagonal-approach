# diagonal-approach
Integer programming for implementation of the diagonal appraoch.

This is an app to provide examples for Chapter 2 of my PhD thesis, published in Social Science and Medicine.

The app demonstrates why the diagonal health system equation is required, and can be used to demonstrate how sub-optimal allocation ocurrs when one type of horizontal intervention is not considered, or when different types of horizontal interventions are evaluated seperately.
